# Design Documents

This directory contains design documents that outline how to implement significant changes or features in the project.

## Purpose

Design documents serve as forward-looking blueprints that plan the implementation of complex functionality. They bridge the gap between feature requirements ("what we need") and actual implementation ("how we'll build it").

## When to Create a Design Document

Create a design document when:
- Implementing a complex feature (typically SP5+)
- Making significant architectural changes
- Planning a refactoring that affects multiple components
- Designing a new subsystem or service
- Creating a migration strategy for existing functionality

# [Design Document Title]

## Overview
Brief summary of what this design aims to accomplish and why.

## Goals
- Clear list of what this design should achieve
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements

## Non-Goals
- Explicitly state what this design is NOT trying to solve
- Set boundaries to prevent scope creep

## Current State
Description of the current system relevant to this design.

## Proposed Solution
Detailed explanation of the implementation approach.

### Component 1
Details about this component...

### Component 2
Details about this component...

## Alternative Approaches
Other approaches considered and why they were rejected.

## Testing Strategy
How the implementation will be tested.

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step approach to implementing this design.

## Rollout and Migration Strategy
How to roll out changes, especially if they affect existing functionality.

## Risks and Mitigations
Known risks and how they'll be addressed.

## Open Questions
Any unresolved questions that need further discussion.
```

## Maintenance

- Design documents should be kept up-to-date as implementation progresses
- Mark design documents as implemented once completed
- Document any significant deviations from the original design during implementation
- Reference the design document in relevant code comments and commit messages
