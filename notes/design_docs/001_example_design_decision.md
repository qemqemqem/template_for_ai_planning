# Describe Design Decision

Here I describe the decision in broad strokes.

# Possibilities

Here are some possible ways of solving this:

1. Use the `foo` library
2. Write it from scratch
3. Use the `bar` library

# Authentication Implementation Design

## Overview
This document outlines how we'll implement the user authentication system.

## Proposed Solution
We'll use a token-based authentication system with JWT:

1. **Registration Flow**:
   - Validate email format and password strength
   - Hash password with bcrypt before storage
   - Send verification email with secure token

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Validate credentials against database
   - Generate JWT with appropriate expiration
   - Include refresh token mechanism

3. **Security Measures**:
   - Rate limiting on login attempts
   - CSRF protection
   - Secure cookie settings

## Implementation Plan
1. Create user model with secure password fields
2. Implement registration endpoint with validation
3. Build login system with JWT generation
4. Add password reset functionality
5. Implement session management

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for auth flows
- Security testing for common vulnerabilities
