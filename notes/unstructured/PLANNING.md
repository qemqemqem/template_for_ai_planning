# Unstructured Instructions

This directory, `notes/unstructured` is a place to put documents with goals about the project. For example, specifications from a client might come in as a long document.

The goal with this directory is that everything here (excluding this explanatory document) should be moved out the unstructured documents and into structured feature requests in the `notes/features/` directory. Whenever there is content in this directory, it probably means that there is design work to be done to structure that document into detailed feature requests. Do that by deleting sections from the unstructured documents, creating a new file somewhere else (or editing an existing feature file), and leaving a line like this in the unstructured file:

See: notes/features/001_example_feature.md
