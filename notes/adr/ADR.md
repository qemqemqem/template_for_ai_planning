# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made in the project.

## Purpose

ADRs capture the context, rationale, and consequences of important architectural decisions. They serve as a historical record of why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives, providing valuable context for future development.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Technology selection (frameworks, databases, etc.)
- System architecture (services, components, patterns)
- Data models and schemas
- API design principles
- Security approaches
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, etc.)
- Significant changes to existing architecture

## Template Structure

```markdown
---
id: [ADR ID, e.g. adr-001]
title: [descriptive title]
status: [proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
deciders: [people involved in the decision]
supersedes: [ID of ADR this replaces, if applicable]
superseded_by: [ID of ADR that replaced this, if applicable]

# [Title of the Architecture Decision]

## Context

Describe the forces at play, including technological, business, and project constraints that influenced the decision. This section answers the question: "What is the environment in which this decision is being made?"

## Decision

State the decision clearly and concisely. This section answers the question: "What approach did we decide on?"

## Consequences

Describe the resulting context after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the positive ones. This section answers the question: "What happens after the decision is applied?"

### Positive
- List positive consequences
- ...

### Negative
- List negative consequences
- ...

### Neutral
- List neutral consequences
- ...

## Alternatives Considered

List the alternatives that were considered and rejected. For each alternative, explain why it wasn't chosen.

### [Alternative 1]
Description and reasons for rejection...

### [Alternative 2]
Description and reasons for rejection...

## Additional Information

Any additional information that would be helpful in understanding the decision, such as examples, diagrams, or related decisions.
```

## Numbering Convention

ADR files should be numbered sequentially using a three-digit number prefix:
- `001_database_technology_selection.md`
- `002_authentication_approach.md`
- etc.

## Document Lifecycle

Architecture Decision Records follow this lifecycle:

- **Proposed**: Initial decision proposal
- **Accepted**: Decision has been accepted and is being implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not accepted
- **Deprecated**: Decision was once accepted but is no longer valid
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer decision

ADRs are considered immutable once accepted. If a decision needs to be changed, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one and update the status of both ADRs to reflect their relationship.

## References in Code

When implementing code affected by an ADR:
- Add references to the ADR in relevant module docstrings
- Include ADR references in comments for implementations that directly relate to the decision
- Reference the ADR in commit messages when implementing the decision

## Maintenance

- ADRs are considered immutable once accepted
- If a decision needs to be changed, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Update the status of both ADRs to reflect their relationship
