# Database Technology Selection

## Context

Our application needs a database solution that can store user data, product information, and transaction records. We need to balance performance, scalability, and development speed.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database technology because:
- It supports both relational and document data models
- It has robust transaction support and ACID compliance
- It offers excellent performance for our expected workload
- The team has existing expertise with PostgreSQL

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong data integrity and consistency guarantees
- Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions
- Good performance for both read and write operations
- Supports complex queries and reporting needs

### Negative
- May require more server resources than NoSQL alternatives
- Less horizontal scalability compared to distributed databases
- Requires schema planning and migration management

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
Would provide more flexibility for evolving data models but lacks the transactional guarantees we need for financial data.

### MySQL
Similar capabilities to PostgreSQL but with less advanced features for our specific use cases.

## Additional Information

This decision relates to [feature-001](../features/001_example_feature.md) which requires reliable data storage with transaction support.
