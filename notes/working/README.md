# Working Documents

This directory contains active tracking documents used during the development process.

## Purpose

Working documents help maintain context about ongoing work and provide a record of development progress. Unlike other documentation that focuses on requirements, design, or knowledge, these documents are actively updated during implementation.

## Documents in this Directory

- **current_goal.md**: Tracks the task currently being worked on, including objectives, progress, and next steps
- **checkpoints.md**: Records stable points in development that can serve as rollback targets if needed

## Usage Guidelines

### Current Goal

Update `current_goal.md` when:
- Starting a new task
- Making significant progress on the current task
- Encountering blockers or changing direction
- Completing a task and preparing for the next one

### Checkpoints

Record a new checkpoint in `checkpoints.md` when:
- Reaching a stable implementation milestone
- Before starting a risky or complex change
- After completing a significant feature or fix
- When creating a known-good state to potentially return to

## Maintenance

- Keep these documents updated as work progresses
- Clear completed tasks and add new ones as needed
- Reference formal documentation (features, design docs, etc.) when relevant
- Use these documents to maintain context between development sessions
