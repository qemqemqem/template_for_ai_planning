# Feature Documentation

This directory contains feature specifications that define what needs to be built from a functional perspective.

## Purpose

Feature documents specify the requirements, behaviors, and acceptance criteria for functionality that needs to be implemented. They focus on the "what" rather than the "how" of implementation.

## When to Create a Feature Document

Create a feature document when:
- Implementing new functionality requested by users or stakeholders
- Extending existing functionality with new capabilities
- Converting unstructured requirements into formal specifications
- Planning work that delivers user-facing value

## Template Structure

# [Feature Title]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

## Background
Context about why this feature is needed and how it fits into the larger system.

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
- As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Specific behavior or capability the system must provide
2. Another required behavior or capability
3. ...

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance expectations
2. Security requirements
3. Usability considerations
4. ...

## Acceptance Criteria
Clear, testable conditions that must be satisfied for the feature to be considered complete:

1. When [precondition], then [expected result]
2. When [precondition], then [expected result]
3. ...

## UI/UX Considerations
Any specific user interface or user experience requirements.

## Dependencies
Other features, systems, or components this feature depends on.

## Out of Scope
Explicitly state what is not included in this feature to prevent scope creep.

## Implementation Notes
Optional section with hints or constraints for implementation, without specifying the exact approach.
```

## Numbering Convention

Feature files should be numbered sequentially using a three-digit number prefix:
- `001_user_authentication.md`
- `002_dashboard_reporting.md`
- etc.

This numbering does not necessarily indicate priority or implementation order.

## Maintenance

- Update feature status as it moves through implementation
- Add links to related design documents once created
- Document any changes to requirements during implementation
- Reference feature documents in commit messages when implementing
