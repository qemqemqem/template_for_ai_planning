# Coding Style Guide

## Naming & Structure

- Use descriptive names that explain purpose
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Group related code together logically

## Documentation

- Document reasoning behind non-obvious decisions, not mechanics
- Explain complex algorithms with step-by-step comments
- Keep commit messages informative and precise

## Code Quality

- Validate inputs at the beginning of functions
- Keep interfaces clean with minimal required parameters
- Choose appropriate data structures for required operations
- Prefer to raise errors and catch them at the outer-most place that is sensible

## Readability

- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Use whitespace to improve readability of dense code
- Optimize only after ensuring correctness
- Comment any non-obvious performance improvements
