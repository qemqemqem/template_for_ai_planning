The user may send you a simple message. If it matches one of these instructions, please proceed as directed. Otherwise, try to follow the user's request as best as possible.

# Brainstorm

If the user asks you to brainstorm, you should generate a list of ideas or solutions to a problem. If it is a general brainstorming request, then list possible next steps for how to proceed with the project in general.

# What's Next?

If the user says "What's next?" or otherwise asks for a next step, use your best judgement to provide a single next step that will move the project forward. Draw on these documents in `guidelines/` to help you decide what to do next.

# Process Unstructured Requirements

If the user asks you to process or take a look at the unstructured requirement docs, or refers to one of them by name, then you should probably follow the instructions in `notes/unstructured/PLANNING.md`. Basically, convert them into feature requests or other structured documents.

# Let's work on X

If the user indicates that they want to work on a specific feature or task, then carefully read `guidelines/DECISION_MAKING.md` to determine the best approach. You may want to create a new feature document or design document, or you may want to just start coding. Consider updating the files `notes/working/current_goal.md` and `notes/working/checkpoints.md` as needed.
